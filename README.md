## Easy Contact PRIVACY POLICY
- This Privacy Policy defines how KNOWARTH collects and uses users personal and non-personal information and data in our mobile applications Easy Contact.
- Personal information you provide to a Vendor (third-party), such as your full name and email address, is stored in the Easy Contact database and shared with the Vendor(s) on your behalf.
- QR Codes and Datamatrix codes can encode contact information. Upon scanning such a code from camera, you will be prompted to add the contact information to your contacts list. In addition, Easy Contact can encode a contact as a QR Code and present it on-screen, so that a friend can point their phone at your screen to transfer that contact. This is why the app requests permission to write and read contacts. They are not used in any other way.
- The Easy Contact contains no viruses or malware. To ensure you get the official copy from this project, only download Bar code Scanner from Google Play.
 
## SECURING USER DATA
KNOWARTH will take all possible steps to ensure your personal information is secure at all times, including, but not limited to: the use of data security systems and up-to-date security procedures. However, due to the nature of the Internet, KNOWARTH cannot guarantee your personal information will be safe from every threat, breach, or malfunction.
 
## UPDATING THIS STATEMENT
KNOWARTH may update this privacy statement by posting a new version on the Easy Contact mobile application. User should check this page occasionally to ensure they are familiar with all and any changes.
